As part of my ~side-quest~, I was a front desk associate for a local pilates studio, and every Monday (the days I was scheduled for), I was tasked with doing inventory via Google Sheets.
Now, every week, we'd have to copy/paste over the previous week's data and override it...not very efficient. So as a side project, this script is meant to automate that copy/paste over. 
Maybe if you are also front desk of a fitness studio, you could use this too! (ask me about my killer form on the reformer as well ;))
